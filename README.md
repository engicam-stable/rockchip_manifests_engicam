# Rockchip Linux SDK

## Get repo

###### You have different ways to get repo on your machine.

Many distros include repo, so you might be able to install from there.
```sh
# Debian/Ubuntu.
$ sudo apt-get install repo

# Gentoo.
$ sudo emerge dev-vcs/repo
```

You can install it manually as well as it's a single script.
```sh
$ mkdir -p ~/.bin
$ PATH="${HOME}/.bin:${PATH}"
$ curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/.bin/repo
$ chmod a+rx ~/.bin/repo
```

You can clone it from Rockchip.
```sh
$ mkdir -p ~/repo
$ git clone https://github.com/rockchip-linux/repo ${HOME}/repo
$ PATH="${HOME}/repo:${PATH}"
```

## The PX30 chips

Sync to the lastest release code:

```sh
$ mkdir px30 && cd px30

repo init --repo-url=https://github.com/rockchip-linux/repo -u https://github.com/engicam-stable/rockchip_manifests_engicam -b px30 -m px30_linux_release.xml
